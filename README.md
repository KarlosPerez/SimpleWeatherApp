# Simple Weather App

A simple app to check current weather and forecast in your current location. 

## Purpose

This is created just for practice, following a tutorial; I used openweathermap API to get the JSON of current weather and 5 days forecast

### What you can find in this project

This is a simple app, information of the current weather is fetched at start. I used the following libraries and assets:

* CardView and RecyclerView to show API info
* ViewPager Layout
* Dexter Library to simplify the process of requesting permissions at runtime
* Retrofit for requests to the API
* Location Services
